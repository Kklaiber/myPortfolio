    <div class="desc2"><h3>I graduated from Bethel School of Technology, a first of its kind, faith-based coding bootcamp in 2018. I completed their Full Stack Web Development program in JavaScript with a 4.0 and gained incredible insight in how to bring character and integrity to the workplace. Along with Bethel's "Coder For Life" program, I am on a life long journey of learning and sharpening my craft. I am passionate about creating spaces where beauty meets practicality. I am geared to find solutions to problems and fully understand areas I am working with to bring excellence and innovation to change the world. I believe we are living in an amazing time where we can use our minds and imaginations to create things never dreamed of before. To inspire the following generations with dreams and ideas to use technology to bring about a better way of life.</h3></div>
